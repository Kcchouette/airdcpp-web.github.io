AirDC++ Web Client 2.9.0 brings various new features, such as messages highlights (can also be added by extensions), new hub chat message notifications, better hash and refresh controls and new home widget for information about recently updated extensions.

## New API features

Extension are now able to add context menu items that open external web links. They are also able to define a form that will be shown when clicking a context menu item to request custom user input that can then be used by the extension when handling the click event. There are also new form field types that can be used for user, hub or file selection.

Extensions will also be able to add custom highlights/links for all chat and status messages, and it's even possible to show custom context menu items when the user clicks the highlighted text.

The share refresh API has also been greatly improved, and it's now possible to list and manage the refresh tasks. There's [a new extension (airdcpp-advanced-sharing)](https://github.com/peps1/airdcpp-advanced-sharing) that takes advantage of many of the new API features (for example, it allows stopping the share refresh after a configured amount of bytes have been added for hashing and resume the refresh after all of them have finished hashing).

## Other feature highlights

#### Extension releases widget

There's a widget that allows you to easily see the latest extension releases/updates directly from the home screen.
