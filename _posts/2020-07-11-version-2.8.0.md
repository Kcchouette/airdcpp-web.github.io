AirDC++ Web Client 2.8.0 brings various new features (mostly for API/extensions) and reliability improvements.

## New API features for extensions

Version 2.8.0 allows extensions or other API consumers to add custom menu items in various different context menus (such as for bundles, search results, filelist items and users). For the full listing of available context menus, please see the [API docs](https://airdcpp.docs.apiary.io/#reference/menus).

In addition, extensions may now also validate new shared directories or files and prevent them from being added in share.

The new API features are being used by the latest version of [airdcpp-release-validator](https://github.com/maksis/airdcpp-release-validator), which now allows scanning individual share roots from the *Share* page or the whole share from the extension context menu:
