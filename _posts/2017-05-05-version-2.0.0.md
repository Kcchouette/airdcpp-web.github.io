Version 2.0.0 provides major improvements to AirDC++ Web API and extensibility.

<!--more-->

## Extensions and documented Web API

AirDC++ Web Client 2.0.0 introduces Web API v1, which is fully documented at [http://apidocs.airdcpp.net](http://apidocs.airdcpp.net).

The most convinient way to access the API is to write an extension that can be installed and managed from within the application itself. The primary extension language is JavaScript ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) and they are written and published as (almost) regular [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) packages.

- [Extension starter project for JavaScript](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-create-extension)
- [Example extensions for Javascript (WebSocket)](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-extension-js/tree/master/examples)
- [Example extension for Python 3.x (HTTP REST)](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-example-python-extension)
- [Extension specifications](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-extensions)

Of course you may also access the API with external scripts or web browsers, and even developing a native remote GUI would be possible.

A few example features that would be possible to implement with extensions:

- Auto search for new content to download
- Ignore chat messages by pattern
- Auto removal of slow download sources
- New validations for shared/downloaded files/directories
- Be notified if users downloading from you don't add the downloaded files in share

## Portable binaries

It's no longer needed to compile the application by yourself on Linux (32-bit/64-bit/ARM architectures).

[Installation instructions](/docs/installation/linux-binaries.html)

If you are migrating to a portable build from an older application version, see the additional migration notes as well. [Nightly builds](http://web-builds.airdcpp.net/develop/) from develop branch are available as well, if you want to keep up with the latest features.


## Dev/support hub

The hub is public and can be accessed with address adcs://web-dev.airdcpp.net:1511
