# Setting up an own hub





## Recommended hub software

### Linux: [uhub](https://www.uhub.org)

A high-performance hubsoft for Unix-like operating systems with basic functionality

### Windows: [ADCH++](http://adchpp.sourceforge.net)

A relative fast hubsoft to set hub (excluding TLS setup).

## Other alternatives

### [Luadch](http://luadch.github.io)

A multiplatform hubsoft with easy setting up. Limited client compatibility with TLS enabled, may not pass all commands between clients. Not recommended for hubs with more than 1000 users.
