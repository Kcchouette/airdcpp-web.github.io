# External HTTP proxy server configuration

Proxying the request can make sense if you have multiple web applications (or an existing web site) and you want them to be accessible from internet from a single, standard port (access to less commonly used port numbers can be blocked in some public networks). Using a proxy server will also simplify certificate management if you want all your web applications to be accessible via HTTPS with a trusted certificate.

See the [community wiki pages](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-webclient/wiki) for more information about available example configurations for different HTTP servers.
