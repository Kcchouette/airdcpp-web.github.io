# Scripting API

Scripting can be done via a [Websocket-based scripting API](https://github.com/airdcpp/airdcpp-webapi). Alternatively you may use regular HTTP calls if you don't need event push notifications from the client.

The API hasn't been documented yet but you can check out the [Javascript API connector project](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-apisocket-js) for basic example scripts.
