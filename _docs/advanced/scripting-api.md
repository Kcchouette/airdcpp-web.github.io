# Scripting API

AirDC++ Web Client includes a [JSON-based scripting API](https://github.com/airdcpp/airdcpp-webapi) that can be accessed via a Websocket or by using HTTP requests. 

The API hasn't been documented yet but you can check out the [Javascript API connector project](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-apisocket-js) for basic example scripts.
